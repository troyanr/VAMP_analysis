# Define which files correspond to which selections.
# The input and output selections should be entries in file_names.
# The input entry should be a pattern of list of file names.
# The output entries should be maps where each map entry is a replicate.
# The replicate entry is either a list of literal file names, or a single regular expression. The 
# regular expression is expanded to include all matching files.
# The files in the input and output replicate entries are treated as lanes and are combined
# by concatenating into a single list of sequences.
